Project Report:
And now what I did with my Chat App:
- I deploy it by build folder, not from Github.
- I add some headings, paragraphs, images +CSS for styling.
I have added an emoticon mapping that can be used by typing on the keyboard.
That's all what I done.
I really like when making this app.

Thanks for reading!
