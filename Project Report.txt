Phat Truong - Chat app:

What I did with my Chat App:

I deployed it by using the build folder, not from Github.
I added some headings, paragraphs, and images (cover, avatar), along with CSS for styling.
I have also added an emoticon mapping that can be used by typing on the keyboard.
That's all I did, no special technology, just very basic stuff.
I really enjoyed making this app.
Thanks for reading!
